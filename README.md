# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Prediction

Sentiment analysis is a challenging subject in machine learning. People express their emotions in a language that is often obscured by sarcasm, ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very misleading for both humans and computers. The goal of the project is to learn from the given dataset using supervised learning algorithm in Spark and predict the sentiment value of the review. It is a binary classification problem. I have used Random Forest Classifier, SVM and Logistic Regression along with TF-IDF and Word2Vec with cross validation for selecting the model with best paramters. For data visualization, Kibana was used.
